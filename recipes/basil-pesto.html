    <h2>Homade basic pesto pasta</h2>
    <p>Pesto or the pesto alla genovese is a traditional Italian sauce made with fresh basil leaves,
        <br> pine nuts, garlic, salt, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil. For hundreds of years, pesto was 
        <br> made by pounding the ingredients in a mortar and pestle. It dates back from Roman times.
        </p>
    <h3>INGRIDIENTS:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups fresh basil leaves, packed (can sub half the basil leaves with baby spinach)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Romano or Parmesan cheese (about 2 ounces)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup pine nuts (can sub chopped walnuts)</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pulse the basil and pine nuts:
            <br>Place the basil leaves and pine nuts into the bowl of a food processor and 
            <br>pulse several times.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and cheese:
            <br>Add the garlic and Parmesan or Romano cheese and pulse several times more. 
            <br>Scrape down the siddes of the food processor with a rubber spatula.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour in the olive oil:
            <br>While the food processor is running, slowly add the olive oil in a steady 
            <br>small stream. Adding the olive oil slowly while the processor is running 
            <br>will help it emulsify and help keep the olive oil from separating. 
            <br>Occasionally, stop to scrape down the sides of the food processor.</li>
        <li>Season the pesto sauce:
            <br>Add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
     </ol>
