        <li>Extra parsley and chives</li>
    <h4>Optional:</h4>
        <li>¼ cup freshly grated parmesan cheese

            <br>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or foil.
            <br> Slice bread in half lengthwise and place on a large baking sheet, cut sides up.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix butter, garlic, parsley and salt together until well combined.
            <br>Spread evenly over bread.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes or until slightly golden brown on the edges. If you want to add 
            <br> cheese, add it the last 2 minutes of baking. If you like a crispier garlic bread,  
            <br>bake for 3-5 minutes more, watching carefully until it is as golden as you like.</li>
