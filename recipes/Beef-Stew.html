            <li>Preheat oven to 325° F.</li>
            <li>Season the beef chunks on all sides with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the flour over and toss the seasoned beef to coat it on all sides
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Brown the beef 
                <br>in batches, on all sides, for 3-4 minutes per batch. Don’t worry

            <li>Add the potatoes, beef broth, tomato paste, bay leaf, thyme, and Worcestershire sauce, and 
                <br> use a wooden spoon to scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring, and return the beef to the pot. 
                <br> Cover the Dutch oven, and transfer to the preheated oven</li>

            <li>Cook the stew for 2-2.5 hours, or until the beef is very tender. Remove the bay leaf.
