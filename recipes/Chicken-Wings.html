    <h3>INGRIDIENTS:</h3>
    <h4>Chicken Wings</h4>
    <ul>    
        <li>1.5 kg chicken wings.</li>
        <li>2 level tbsp aluminium-free baking powder - (It has to be baking powder, NOT baking soda) - 
            <br> see further notes on baking powder below.</li>
        <li>¾ tsp salt - (make sure it's regular table salt).</li>
        <li>½ tsp pepper.</li>
        <li>3 tbsp chopped spring onions/scallions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sticky Asian Sauce</h4> 
    <ul>   
        <li>1 tsp vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>1 thumb-sized piece of ginger - peeled and minced.</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sweet chilli sauce.</li>
        <li>2 tbsp honey.</li>
        <li>4 tbsp brown sugar.</li>
        <li>5 tbsp dark soy sauce.</li>
        <li>1 tsp lemon grass paste.</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic - peeled and minced.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 120C/250F and place a rack on a large baking tray.</li>
        <li>Cut each wing at the joint so you have a mini wing and a drumette. Dry the wings 
            <br>with paper towels, then place in a large bowl and add the baking powder, salt 
            <br>and pepper. Toss to combine. Note - it's important to dry the wings first so 
            <br>they only get a lightcoating. Discard any remaining coating once tossed together. </li>
        <li>Place in a single layer on the rack, skin side up. It's fine for them to be touching. 
            <br>Place on the lower shelf of the oven for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 30 minutes, turn the oven up to 220c (425f), rotate the tray and place
            <br>on a higher shelf (higher middle) in the oven for 45-50 minutes until the wings
            <br>are golden and crispy. Take out of the oven to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Place all of the sauce ingredients into a saucepan, stir and bring to the boil. Allow to
            <br>bubble for 5-10 minutes until the sauce reduces and thickens slightly (it will thicken 
            <br>more as it cools). Turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Place the wings in a large bowl and very carefully pour over the sticky sauce (be careful,
            <br>it will VERY hot). Toss to combine, then serve topped with chopped spring onions.</li>
     </ol>
